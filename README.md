# Graduation Project Name: Portal_CKC
   ## Technology:
   - **UI and Process**: *Dart and Flutter*
   - **Database**: *SQLite*
   - **Web API**: *Laravel*
   - **RESTful API**: _Chopper _
   - **Other Libraries**: _build_runner, flutter_gen, localization, json_serializable,..._
   ## Describe: 
   
   - We use several technologies in our project as follows:
      - We use the **Flutter** framework to build the user interface, and apply the **BLoC** design pattern for            state management throughout the project.
     - In addition, we utilize **Chopper**, an **HTTP Client Generator** library, to simplify, optimize, and               automatically generate HTTP-related code, making it easier to interact with **RESTful APIs**.
      - We also implement libraries such as localizations, along with flutter_gen, which helps generate and                manage asset paths, including image references.
